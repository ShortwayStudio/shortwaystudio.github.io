Automatically start Spotify when driving? Keep your phone locked while on your bike? Count steps while you're walking? You got it! With Detact and Tasker, there are endless possibilities. How about measuring the time you spend sitting in a chair all day?
  
Detact uses technology already in your device, meaning it doesn't use any valuable battery power! (Specifically, Detact uses the Activity Recognition Transition API.)
  
Detact may also work with other apps using the Locale API, such as Locale, Llama, Automate, Automagic and others. However, this is not tested extensively.
  
To support development, Detact contains non-intrusive ads. These can be removed with a small in-app purchase.
  
Please understand that Detact is still considered to be in beta. There may be bugs.
